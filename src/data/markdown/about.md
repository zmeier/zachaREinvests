Hi, my name is Zach and welcome to my website. This website was created with the intention of bringing us together so we both may benefit from each other. Since you are visiting this site you are most likely selling or beginning to think about selling your property. If this is you, I want to be your buyer. I am very excited about the opportunity to buy and sell real estate because I think it is a great way to diversify and grow my investment portfolio.<!-- end_excerpt -->

I am a software engineer and throughout my life I have always heard "Get a good job, work hard, and invest your money for retirement." For most of my life I didn't think too much about the last part, investing for retirement. Most people around me have said to put as much money into my 401k as possible and invest the rest in a brokerage account. I believe this is sound advice, but I was not active in my investments and only really paid attention to the line graphs showing the rise and fall in value of my brokerage account. I made a goal in 2019 to take an active role in my investments so that I knew how I was growing and saving my money for retirement.

To expand my knowledge I started researching investing online, listening to podcasts, and buying books such as Set for Life by Scott Trench and Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyowsaki. My research led me to discover real estate investing. This was an investment area I hadn't hear much about before, but intrigued me because it would allow me to diversify my investments, run my own business, and play an active role in knowing how I was working towards retirement.

There are many different forms of real estate investing. I have decided that now is a good time to invest in land as the majority of real estate investors are looking to buy, sell, rent, and flip houses while land has been largely ignored. This means that it is a lot harder for land owners to find buyers. I want to provide a solution for the owners of vacant land who are looking to sell their property.

If you are interested in selling your property, please submit the contact form and I will get back to you as soon as possible. I look forward to working with you!
