Hi, my name is Zach and welcome to my website. This website was created with the intention of bringing us together so we both may benefit from each other. Since you are visiting this site you are most likely selling or beginning to think about selling your property. If this is you, I want to be your buyer. I am very excited about the opportunity to buy and sell real estate because I think it is a great way to diversify and grow my investment portfolio.<!-- end_excerpt -->

I am a software engineer and I have always wanted to run my own startup. In 2019, I made a goal to take a more active role in my investments. I have found that real estate allows me to both run my own startup and focus on investing. There are many different forms of real estate investing. I have decided to focus on vacant land as the majority of real estate investors are looking to buy, sell, rent, and flip houses while land has been largely ignored. This means that it is a lot harder for land owners to find buyers. I want to provide a solution for the owners of vacant land who are looking to sell their property.

If you are interested in selling your property, please submit the <a href="/sell">interest form</a> or <a href="/contact">contact me</a> and I will get back to you as soon as possible. I look forward to working with you!
