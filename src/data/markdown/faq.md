## What type of real estate do you purchase?

My primary focus is on buying vacant land around the United States. I will consider any piece of vacant land regardless of its condition.

## Why do you want to buy my land?

I want to provide land owners a means to sell their property. I will use the land to help foster economic growth in the local community. There are many possible uses for vacant land.
* Finding prospective homeowners looking to build their dream home
* Developing the land to be used as a rental property
* Depending on zoning, land can be used for camping, ATV trails, or mountain biking trails
* Large parcels of land can be subdivided to allow multiple homeowners to build their dream homes
* Rent the land to local farmers
* And many more
