## What type of real estate do you purchase?

My primary focus is on buying vacant land in rural areas around the United States. I will consider any piece of vacant land regardless of its condition.

## Why do you want to buy my land?

I want to buy your land to help put cash back into your pocket while providing me the opportunity to create a small business. 

I have always wanted to run my own company, but never known where to start. When I learned about the ability to start my own business that invests in real estate, I was intrigued. I have found that now is a good time to invest in land as the majority of real estate investors are looking to buy, sell, rent, and flip houses; however, land has been largely ignored. This means that it is a lot harder for land owners to sell their poperty because there are far fewer people buying vacant land. I want to provide a solution for the owners of vacant land who no longer want to own their property.
